								<h2>PROGRAM AND DATA MANAGER</h2>
								<p>[Program Management] | [Data Science] | [Technical Solutions]</p>
								<p>As a seasoned Program and Data Manager with over a decade of public sector experience at organizations like <a href="https://a069-access.nyc.gov/accesshra/">New York City HRA</a> and <a href="https://www.comprehensiveliferesources.org/">Comprehensive Life Resources</a>, I bring full digital mastery to every challenge—spanning input and output systems from CAD design and 3D art to graphic design, video editing, coding in languages like Python and SQL, text-based content creation, AI algorithms, and machine learning models. Having fully mastered traditional architectures across Adobe, Google, and Microsoft suites, alongside cutting-edge cloud platforms like Azure and advanced data tools, there's nothing in the current computing landscape I can't proficiently handle or rapidly learn, empowering me to drive innovative solutions in data-driven decision-making, cultural projects, and multidisciplinary collaborations. I have purposefully chosen here to have an extra-long resume as a distinct showcase of my wide range of skills and experiences as well as a formal and fearless declaration of my abilities. My roles are often short as I optimally solve the issue I’m hired for while training and documenting thoroughly for the continuation of that system after.</p>
